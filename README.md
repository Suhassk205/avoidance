Obstacle Avoidance Drone

Overview:
This project involves the development of an obstacle avoidance system for drones using advanced algorithms and sensor integration, aimed at enhancing autonomous navigation capabilities.

Objective:
The main objective is to design and implement a drone that can autonomously navigate through an environment while avoiding obstacles using real-time sensor data.

Features:

Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance
Integration with GPS for waypoint navigation
User-friendly interface for monitoring and control
Data logging for performance analysis
Technologies Used:
The project is built using ROS (Robot Operating System), Python, OpenCV for image processing, and various sensors including ultrasonic and LiDAR.

Installation Instructions:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory: cd obstacle_avoidance_drone
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Follow additional setup steps if necessary.
Usage:
Launch the ROS nodes using the provided launch file and start the droneâ€™s obstacle avoidance algorithm to see it in action.
